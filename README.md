**AI-Powered Text Completion - Cognizant Generative AI Program** <br />
*Capstone Project #2 - Alex Olson* <br />

*(alexko22 is my school github and triplezop is my personal; sorry for any confusion as my account changes for which device I am using)* <br />

**Setup Info:** <br />
To perform this experiment as I did, you will need to install the OpenAI library to your personal enviornment, as well as have a valid API key saved as a variable. From there you should be able to utilize the .py file as is!

**Project Info:** <br />
All of the project recap, info, and reflections are contained within the pdf document! The code for the experiment is contained within the py file. Thanks for a great experience in the Cognizant Generative AI Externship!
